git grep -l 'old_name' | xargs sed -i '' -e 's/old_name/new_name/g'
git grep -l 'OldName' | xargs sed -i '' -e 's/OldName/NewName/g'
mv ./lib/old_name ./lib/new_name
mv ./lib/old_name.ex ./lib/new_name.ex
If you have a similar folder structure in the tests folder, you probably also need:
mv ./test/old_name ./test/new_name
mv ./lib/old_name_web ./lib/new_name_web
mv ./lib/old_name_web.ex ./lib/new_name_web.ex

docker-compose pull
docker-compose build --pull faithful_word
docker-compose up --build -d postgres
docker-compose run --rm faithful_word migrate
docker-compose run --rm faithful_word seed

Booting the application in Docker-Compose

docker-compose up --build faithful_word

You can then browse the application by visiting http://localhost:4000 as normal, and should see the typical (production-style) log output in the shell session that’s running the above docker-compose command.

Note that this running container will not pick up any new file changes, perform live-reload behavior, and is generally not useful for development purposes. It’s primary value is ensuring that your release is properly configured via Distillery, and that your Dockerfile remains viable.
Cleaning Up

If you’d like to reset the database, or otherwise clean up after the Docker-Compose environment, you can use the down subcommand, optionally including a flag to clear the data volume as well. Without the flag, it will still remove the containers and Docker-specific network that was created for you.

`docker-compose down --volume`
